(iteration:)
Use one of the languages you used for assignment 2.

Save the source file with proper extension and provide a build file to run the code. Don't write any tests, only code for this question. Follow language conventions.

Write a function that will take a number (assume >= 1) as parameter and 
return the sum of square of numbers from 1 to the number. For example, given 
5, the result will be 55, since 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 totals to that value.

Write the function using iteration but without using any mutable variable anywhere in the code.

Call the function for input values of 1, 3, 5, and 8.

Keep the type as integer, don't worry about long or biginteger.
