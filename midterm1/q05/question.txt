Write a function that takes a string where the characters will be numbers 
only. The string may be of any length, zero or more. A given 
string may contain the numbers "087237913776829423439457956" for example. 
The function should return the number of occurrences of each number in the given string.

Do not use recursion. Do not use any mutable variables anywhere in the code.

You may use any language you like and save the source file with proper 
extension. Use language conventions. Provide a build file to run the program. 
Call the function with the following strings in your program:

"087237913776829423439457956"
"56876443467899987643322"
"69742234677888888765543322222111"
