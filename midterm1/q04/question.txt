(functional:)
In a language of your choice, write a guessing game program. When started, the
program picks a number between 1 and 100. Prompts the user to guess. Provides 
a message if the value guessed is higher or lower than the number. When the 
user figures out the number, it displays the number of attempts the user took.

Keep this as a short console application.

Write the code using functional style (no recursion) with no explicit 
mutability.

Keep your code in a separate file with proper extension so we can actually run 
the program. Create a build file to easily run the program.
