Do not use recursion, do not write any tests. Use a dynamically typed language (no JavaScript).

Write a program that reads a positive number (assume number entered is positive) from the console and prints prime numbers that are greater than the entered number, one per second, until the user terminates the program.

Provide a script to easily run the program.
