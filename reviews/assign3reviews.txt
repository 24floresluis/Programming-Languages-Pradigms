Please take small steps. Lot of influent code vs. small amount of fluent code we can build on. Choose the latter, please.

Please see suggestions in code.     

After making these tests to pass, then write a third test where we call name within the {}.

synopsis: let's change the testing tool 

details:
Let's use Spock to write tests instead of GroovyTestCase.

After the canary test, let's write the following test
                                                     
void "test call schedule meeting"() {
	expect:
	  schedule.meeting {}
}

Let's make that test to pass. Then ask for a review by dropping an email.
